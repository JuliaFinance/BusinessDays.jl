A highly optimized *Business Days* calculator written in Julia language.
Also known as *Working Days* calculator.

## Installation

```julia
julia> Pkg.add("BusinessDays")
```

## Motivation

This code was developed with a mindset of a Financial Institution that has a big *Fixed Income* portfolio. Many financial contracts, specially *Fixed Income instruments*, depend on a particular calendar of holidays to determine how many days exist between the valuation date and the maturity of the contract. A *Business Days* calculator is a small piece of software used to perform this important step of the valuation process.
While there are many implementations of *Business Days* calculators out there, the usual implementation is based on this kind of algorithm:
```R
dt0 = initial_date
dt1 = final_date
holidays = vector_of_holidays
bdays = 0
while d0 <= d1
    if d0 not in holidays
        bdays = bdays + 1
    end
    d0 = d0 + 1
end while
```

This works fine for general use. But the performance becomes an issue if one must repeat this calculation many times. Say you have 50 000 contracts, each contract with 20 cash flows. If you need to apply this algorithm to each cash flow, you will need to perform it 1 000 000 times.

For instance, let's try out this code using *R* and *[QuantLib](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib)* ([RQuantLib](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rquantlib)):
```R
library(RQuantLib)
library(microbenchmark)

from <- as.Date("2015-06-29")
to <- as.Date("2100-12-20")
microbenchmark(businessDaysBetween("Brazil", from, to))

from_vect <- rep(from, 1000000)
to_vect <- rep(to, 1000000)
microbenchmark(businessDaysBetween("Brazil", from_vect, to_vect), times=1)
```

Running this code, we get the following: *(only the fastest execution is shown)*
```
Unit: milliseconds
                                    expr     min
 businessDaysBetween("Brazil", from, to) 1.63803

Unit: seconds
                                              expr      min
 businessDaysBetween("Brazil", from_vect, to_vect) 1837.476

```

While one computation takes up to 2 milliseconds, we're in trouble if we have to repeat it for the whole portfolio: it takes about **half an hour** to complete. This is not due to R's performance, because *[RQuantLib](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rquantlib)* is a simple wrapper to [QuantLib](https://github.com/lballabio/QuantLib) *C++* library.

**BusinessDays.jl** uses a *tailor-made* cache to store Business Days results, reducing the time spent to the order of a few *microseconds* for a single computation. Also, the time spent to process the whole portfolio is reduced to **under a second**.

It's also important to point out that the initialization of the memory cache, which is done only once for each Julia runtime session, takes less than *half a second*, including JIT compilation time. Also, the *memory footprint* required for each cached calendar should take around 0.7 MB.

**Benchmark Code**

```julia
julia> using BusinessDays, Dates

julia> d0 = Date(2015, 06, 29) ; d1 = Date(2100, 12, 20) ;

julia> cal = BusinessDays.Brazil()
BusinessDays.BRSettlement()

julia> @time BusinessDays.initcache(cal)
  0.161972 seconds (598.85 k allocations: 30.258 MiB, 2.29% gc time)

julia> bdays(cal, d0, d1) # force JIT compilation
21471 days

julia> @time bdays(cal, d0, d1)
  0.000012 seconds (9 allocations: 240 bytes)
21471 days

julia> @time for i in 1:1000000 bdays(cal, d0, d1) end
  0.221275 seconds (5.00 M allocations: 76.294 MiB, 2.93% gc time)
```

**There's no magic**

If we disable BusinessDays's cache, however, the performance is slightly worse than QuantLib's implementation. It takes around 38 minutes to process the same benchmark test.

```julia
julia> BusinessDays.cleancache() # cleans existing cache, if any

julia> @time for i in 1:1000000 bdays(cal, d0, d1) end
# 2288.906548 seconds (5.00 M allocations: 76.294 MB, 0.00% gc time)
```

It's important to point out that **cache is disabled by default**. So, in order to take advantage of high speed computation provided by this package, one must call `BusinessDays.initcache` function.

## Usage

```julia
julia> using BusinessDays, Dates

julia> BusinessDays.initcache(:USSettlement) # creates cache for US Federal holidays, allowing fast computations

julia> isbday(:USSettlement, Date(2015, 1, 1)) # Calendars can be referenced using symbols
false

julia> isbday("USSettlement", Date(2015, 1, 1)) # ... and also strings
false

julia> isbday(BusinessDays.USSettlement(), Date(2015, 1, 1)) # but for the best performance, use a singleton instance
false

julia> tobday(:USSettlement, Date(2015, 1, 1)) # Adjust to next business day
2015-01-02

julia> tobday(:USSettlement, Date(2015, 1, 1); forward = false) # Adjust to last business day
2014-12-31

julia> advancebdays(:USSettlement, Date(2015, 1, 2), 1) # advances 1 business day
2015-01-05

julia> advancebdays(:USSettlement, Date(2015, 1, 2), -1) # goes back 1 business day
2014-12-31

julia> bdays(:USSettlement, Date(2014, 12, 31), Date(2015, 1, 5)) # counts the number of business days between dates
2 days

julia> bdayscount(:USSettlement, Date(2014, 12, 31), Date(2015, 1, 5)) # same as above, but returns integer
2

julia> isbday(:USSettlement, [Date(2014,12,31),Date(2015,1,1),Date(2015,1,2),Date(2015,1,3),Date(2015,1,5)])
5-element Array{Bool,1}:
  true
 false
  true
 false
  true

julia> bdays(:USSettlement, [Date(2014,12,31),Date(2015,1,2)], [Date(2015,1,5),Date(2015,1,5)])
2-element Array{Base.Dates.Day,1}:
 2 days
 1 day

```

## Package Documentation

**HolidayCalendar**

*Abstract* type for Holiday Calendars.

**BusinessDays.easter_rata(y::Year) → Int**

Returns Easter date as a *[Rata Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rata_Die)* number.

**BusinessDays.easter_date(y::Year) → Date**

Returns result of `easter_rata` as a `Date` instance.

**BusinessDays.findweekday(weekday_target::Int, yy::Int, mm::Int, occurrence::Int, ascending::Bool) → Date**

Given a year `yy` and month `mm`, finds a date where a choosen weekday occurs.

`weekday_target` values are declared in module `Base.Dates`: 
`Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday,Saturday,Sunday = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7`.

If `ascending` is true, searches from the beggining of the month. If false, searches from the end of the month.

If `occurrence` is `2` and `weekday_target` is `Monday`, searches the 2nd Monday of the given month, and so on.

**isholiday(calendar, dt)**

Checks if `dt` is a holiday based on a given `calendar` of holidays.

`calendar` can be an instance of `HolidayCalendar`,  a `Symbol` or an `AbstractString`.

Returns boolean values.

**isweekend(dt)**

Returns `true` for Saturdays or Sundays.
Returns `false` otherwise.

**isbday(calendar, dt)**

Returns `true` for weekends or holidays.
Returns `false` otherwise.

**tobday(calendar, dt; [forward=true])**

Adjusts `dt` to next Business Day if it's not a Business Day.
If `isbday(dt)`, returns `dt`.

**advancebdays(calendar, dt, bdays_count)**

Increments given date `dt` by `bdays_count`.
Decrements it if `bdays_count` is negative.
`bdays_count` can be a `Int`, `Vector{Int}` or a `UnitRange`.

Computation starts by next Business Day if `dt` is not a Business Day.

**bdays(calendar, dt0, dt1)**

Counts the number of Business Days between `dt0` and `dt1`.
Returns instances of `Dates.Day`.

Computation is always based on next Business Day if given dates are not Business Days.

**bdayscount(calendar, dt0, dt1)**

Same as `bdays`, but returns `Int`.

**firstbdayofmonth(calendar, dt)** , **firstbdayofmonth(calendar, yy, mm)**

Returns the first business day for a given month.

**lastbdayofmonth(calendar, dt)** , **lastbdayofmonth(calendar, yy, mm)**

Returns the last business day for a given month.

**listholidays(calendar, dt0::Date, dt1::Date) → Vector{Date}**

Returns the list of holidays between `dt0` and `dt1`.

**listbdays(calendar, dt0::Date, dt1::Date) → Vector{Date}**

Returns the list of business days between `dt0` and `dt1`.

**BusinessDays.initcache(calendar, [d0], [d1])**

Creates cache for a given Holiday Calendar. After calling this function, any call to `isbday`
function, or any function that uses `isbday`, will be optimized to use this cache.

You can pass `calendar` as an instance of `HolidayCalendar`, `Symbol` or `AbstractString`.
You can also pass `calendar` as an `AbstractArray` of those types.

**BusinessDays.cleancache([calendar])**

Cleans cache for a given instance or list of `HolidayCalendar`, `Symbol` or `AbstractString`.

## Adding new Holiday Calendars

You can add your custom Holiday Calendar by doing the following:

1. Define a subtype of `HolidayCalendar`.
2. Implement a new method for `isholiday` for your calendar.

**Example Code**

```julia
julia> using BusinessDays, Dates

julia> struct CustomCalendar <: HolidayCalendar end

julia> BusinessDays.isholiday(::CustomCalendar, dt::Date) = dt == Date(2015,8,27)

julia> cc = CustomCalendar()
CustomCalendar()

julia> isholiday(cc, Date(2015,8,26))
false

julia> isholiday(cc, Date(2015,8,27))
true

julia> isholiday(:CustomCalendar, Date(2015,8,27))
true

julia> isholiday("CustomCalendar", Date(2015,8,27))
true
```

## Generic Holiday Calendar

You can use a fixed set of holidays to define a new Holiday Calendar using `GenericHolidayCalendar` type.

```julia
julia> using BusinessDays, Dates

julia> holidays = Set([Date(2018,1,16), Date(2018,1,18)])

julia> dtmin = Date(2018,1,15); dtmax = Date(2018,1,19)

julia> gen_calendar = GenericHolidayCalendar(holidays, dtmin, dtmax)

julia> bdayscount(gen_calendar, Date(2018,1,15), Date(2018,1,17))
1
```

The constructor is given by: `GenericHolidayCalendar(holidays, [dtmin], [dtmax], [_initcache_])`, where

* `holidays`: a set of holiday dates

* `dtmin`: minimum date allowed to check for holidays in holidays set. Defaults to `min(holidays...)`.

* `dtmax`: maximum date allowed to check for holidays in holidays set. Defaults to `max(holidays...)`.

* `_initcache_`: initializes the cache for this calendar. Defaults to `true`.
